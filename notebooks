# AI-Based Stock Market Analysis & Trading Signal System

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI pipeline for stock market analysis.
It uses historical stock price data to predict prices and generate BUY / SELL / HOLD
trading signals using Machine Learning.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a complete AI-based stock analysis system that:

- Cleans and prepares historical stock data
- Creates technical indicators (Moving Average, Volatility, Returns)
- Predicts stock closing prices using Regression Model
- Generates trading signals (BUY / SELL / HOLD)
- Backtests the trading strategy performance

This simulates how quantitative analysts and trading firms design algorithmic trading systems.


## Dataset Information

- Stock: TATASTEEL (NSE India)
- Time Period: 2023 – 2026
- Rows: ~500 trading days
- Source: Historical NSE equity data

### Features Available
- Open, High, Low, Close price
- Previous Close & Last Traded Price (LTP)
- Volume & Trade Count
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- 52 Week High & Low

### Engineered Features (Created in Project)
- Daily Return
- Moving Average (7, 14, 30 days)
- Volatility
- Volume Change
- Trading Signals


## Machine Learning Model

We trained a **Linear Regression model** to predict the next day closing price.

### Target Variable
- CLOSE price

### Input Features
- OPEN
- HIGH
- LOW
- VOLUME
- MA_7
- MA_14
- MA_30
- VOLATILITY

### Train Test Split
- 80% Training Data
- 20% Testing Data

The model learns the relationship between historical technical indicators and future stock price.

This is a supervised regression problem where the model predicts a continuous value (price).


## Model Evaluation

To measure model accuracy we used:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### Results

MAE ≈ 0.54  
RMSE ≈ 0.71

### Interpretation

The low error values indicate the model can predict stock prices with good accuracy.

RMSE being slightly higher than MAE shows occasional larger deviations, which is normal in stock market prediction due to volatility.

This demonstrates the model successfully learned price movement patterns from historical data.


## Trading Signal Generation

After predicting stock closing prices, we convert predictions into actionable trading signals.

Logic:
- If Predicted Price > Today's Close → BUY
- If Predicted Price < Today's Close → SELL
- Otherwise → HOLD

This transforms the ML model into a decision-making trading system instead of only a prediction model.

## Strategy Backtesting
We evaluated the trading signals using historical data to simulate real trading performance.

If BUY signal → We buy the stock
If SELL signal → We sell the stock
If HOLD → No trade

This helps measure whether the AI model can actually make profit instead of only predicting prices.

## Performance Insight
The AI model was able to capture short-term price trends using technical indicators.

The trading strategy avoided random decisions and instead reacted to predicted price movement.

Although stock markets are unpredictable, the system shows how Machine Learning can support decision-making in trading.

This simulates how quantitative analysts and hedge funds build algorithmic trading systems.

## Conclusion
We successfully built an end-to-end AI powered stock market analysis system.

The project performs:
- Data collection & cleaning
- Feature engineering using technical indicators
- Price prediction using Machine Learning
- Trading signal generation
- Strategy backtesting

This project demonstrates practical application of AI in financial markets and algorithmic trading.
